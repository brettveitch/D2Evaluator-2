# D2Evaluator-2
This is a personal project to help me organize my vault in Destiny 2. It analyzes all possible loadouts based on the armor currently obtained. It then finds the best armor loadout that will maximize the amount of stat points for every combination of 2, 3, and 4 stats. It then adds all of the armor pieces in those loadouts to a set and can print out the ids of those armor pieces to mark which armor pieces to keep in DIM.

In the future I'd like to access the API to cut out the extra steps of exporting a csv of armor from DIM.
